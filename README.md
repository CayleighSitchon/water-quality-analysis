# Water Quality Analysis of the Friant-Kern Canal
This project analyzes elemental contamination in the Friant-Kern Canal, a major water source in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. The data was collected through inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy as part of a research effort focused on assessing environmental water quality.

## Project Background
Apart of a research group, I was involved in multiple stages of this project, including water sample collection from the canal, preparation of those samples for ICP analysis, and data cleaning. To contribute further, I developed a Python-based analysis pipeline to explore elemental concentration trends across sampling locations and time periods.

This was my first applied coding project, using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and it helped me understand how there are many applications using data science that can be used in supporting environmental research and real-world problem-solving.

## Goals
- Visualize monthly trends of elemental concentrations
- Compare contamination levels of key metals (e.g., Thallium, Lead, Arsenic)
- Use heatmaps to highlight spatial patterns across sample sites
- Create a hypothesis about potential sources or entry points of Thallium based on spatial and temporal data
- Practice coding skills in a scientific research context

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for initial data review)
- ICP Spectroscopy (lab instrumentation for elemental analysis)

## Repository Contents
- `Water_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `plots`: Folder containing saved figures generated during analysis
- `data`: Cleaned dataset used for the analysis (included only if permitted)
- `README.md`: This file

## Summary to what I Learned
- How to clean and structure raw lab data for analysis
- How to use Python libraries to visualize and interpret trends in environmental data
- How to work independently on a technical project and clearly document the process
- The value of combining coding and chemical engineering to support environmental health

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to my research advisor and team members for giving me the opportunity to help in the lab and during sample collection.
