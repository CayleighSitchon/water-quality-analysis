    "\n",
    "Hello! My name is Cayleigh, and I am a chemical engineering student at Clovis Community College. This notebook is an independent data analysis project from what I've been working on with a research group on water quality in the Friant-Kern Canal. We're looking to investigate metal concentrations, with special regard for environmental hazard and agricultural runoff. I'm analyzing my research group's data collected from Octoberthrough May(minus Nov and Dec).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a segment of my effort to gain experience in environmental chemistry, data science, and community-impact research. I am also studying Python and MATLAB independently to further understand scientific data and advance my competence in experimental analysis. \n",

    "Below shows parts of my processâ€”cleaning, visualizing, and examines seasonal trends, visualize concentration distributions, and assess potential health risks, with a focus on Thallium (Tl)."
